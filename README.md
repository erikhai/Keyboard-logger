# Keyboard-logger

## What is this project about
This project consists of a script that logs all keyboard inputs into a text file. This little side project delves into cybersecurity and helped me understand the secutiry vulnerablities and importance of protecting sensitive information. 

## What did I learn from this project
1. Developed more documentation skills and debugging skills
2. Learnt how to use pynput
3. Learnt how to track keyboard inputs and how to do it continously until the program is stopped

## What are the future plans for this project
1. Making it more universal. Currently, the keybinds in this program is specialised for a macbook. Whilst this program can be used to track which characters are pressed on other operating systems, I wish to make this script more universablly applicable.
2. Being able to email a copy of the key logs if the application is forcefully exited.
